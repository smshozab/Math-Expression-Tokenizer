# Mathematical Expression Analyzer

This is a semester project on the Theory Of Automata programmed in Python for analyzing mathematical expressions using lexical analysis techniques and displaying DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) diagrams and transition tables.

## Introduction

The Mathematical Expression Analyzer is a tool designed to analyze mathematical expressions inputted by the user. It performs lexical analysis on the expressions to identify tokens such as numeric values, mathematical operators, parentheses, and symbols. Additionally, it validates the input expression and evaluates it to display the result.

## Features

- Lexical analysis of mathematical expressions
- Validation of mathematical expressions
- Evaluation of mathematical expressions
- Display of DFA diagrams
- Display of transition tables

## Getting Started

To use the Mathematical Expression Analyzer, follow these steps:
```bash

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-expression-analyzer.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:
python main.py
